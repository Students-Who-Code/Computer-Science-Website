			<p class="class-description"  style=" color: white;">Computer Science is an integral part of todayâ€™s society and is rapidly becoming an essential skill
	across all disciplines. This course will introduce students to the creative aspects of
	programming, abstractions, algorithms, large data sets, the Internet, cybersecurity concerns,
	and computing impacts. Topics that will be covered include creativity, abstraction, data and
	information, algorithms, programming, the Internet, and global impacts. Students will utilize
	resources such as MIT App Inventor, JavaScript and others to display their understanding of
	computer science principles and create their own computational artifacts. Completed projects 25
	may include mobile apps, websites, music, games, and more. While the course is designed to
	appeal to a wide array of students, it is still a college-level curriculum and will be challenging.</p1>
			<p class="class-description"  style=" color: white;">AP Computer Science Principles is an essential High School coding class. It provides students with challenging projects that test critical 
      skills integral in real world. It also maintains a balance beween projects, tests and hands on activities to keep the students engaged and interested.
      Most of the course focuses on the core algorithms used in today's fields as well as focusing on code that implements it. Java is the main focus language 
      as it is used in most modern applications, devices etc. All in all, this class provides tools for a successful future in the Tech field.</p>

			<h2 class= "subtitle"  style=" color: gold;">About our coders:</h2>
      		<p class="creator-profile" style=" color: white;">N.G.: My first coding class was Robotics 1 my sophmore year. 
        This class was my second choice for an elective, but once I was put in it, it changed my life. 
        After starting this class, I found that coding and building robots was a lot of fun.
        I proceeded to take Mobile Applications and Robotics 2 the following year, and now I am in Robotics 3, CAD 2, Honors Java, and APCSP
        Besides technology, I am a Varsity Tennis player for Wayne Valley, SDA memeber, and a WV Theatre member in the Spring Muscials.
      		</p>
      		<p class="creator-profile" style=" color: white;">K.J: I like to take part in a variety of activities other than technology; playing tennis for the school team, volunteering 
      around town and playing video games consumes most of my time. Looking at technology specifically, I have taken part in all 3 years of Robotics
      as well as Honors Java and now in AP Comp Sci A. Learning about coding and Robotics has been a big part of my HS experience an I hope that
      others enjoy as much as I did.</p>
      
      	<p class="creator-profile" style=" color: white;"> J.A. : I started coding in middle school with a light introduction to basic theory and application. From then on I've had a
      comp sci class every year of my high school experience, with my last year having AP Computer Science Principles and Adv. Comp. Sci. w/ Java. I recommend any
      coder try and get to the latter class as its lots of fun working on large-scale, group-based projects with classmates. Principles is also good for creating a
      foundation for the topic of computer science in anyones head.
