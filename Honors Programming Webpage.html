			<h1>Honors Programming</h1>
			<p>Honors Programming introduces students to several, very powerful topics in Computer Science
			including: Object Oriented program design, Data Encapsulation and Information Hiding. Students will also
			be learning and applying the principles of modular program design and software re-usability. Students in
			this class will be designing their
			own creative software solutions to a variety of challenges. While not a prerequisite, prior
			knowledge of coding may be helpful. Honors Programming is a required prerequisite
			for the Advanced Placement Computer Science A course.</p>
			<p>Grade level: 10-12</p>
			<p>Credits: 5</p>
			<p>Course level: Honors</p>
			<p>Prerequisite: Algebra I; <q>B</q> or higher</p>
			<p>This course is offered as a Dual Enrollment course for college credit.</p>
