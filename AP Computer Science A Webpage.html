		<h2>Course Overview</h2>
		<p>In this class, the students learn everything about coding in Java, from the basics with variables to recursion and arrays. The goal of this course is to prepare the students for the AP Exam while also learning more about the language.</p>
		<h2>Prequisites</h2>
		<p>- Honors Programming</p>
		<p>- Recommended: Coding Concepts/Coding Theory </p>
		<h2>Grading </h2>
		<p>Consists of a mixture of reading quizzes (based off textbook reading), chapter tests, and coding projects.</p>
		<h2>Materials:</h2>
		<p>- Java Textbook</p>
		<p>- Pencil</p>
		<p>- Folder</p>
		<h4>Suggested:</h4>
		<p>- Flash Drive</p>
		<p>- Small Binder (to hold paper)</p>
		<h2>AP Exam</h2>
		<p>Near the end of the year (May), students have the option to take a cumulative exam to test their knowledge of coding in java, consisting of multiple choice and free response questions. If a high score is achieved, the exam could correspond to college credits.</p>
