      <h1><b>Advanced Computer Science with Java</b></h1>
      <h2>Course Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This course follows AP Computer Science A. The emphasis of the course is
        on development and use of standard data structures, developing algorithms,
        and improving programming skills. The course should be of interest to
        students who are considering college work in computer science,
        engineering, statistics, and some business fields.
      </p>
        <h2>Prequisites</h2>
       <ol>
        <li>Honors Java</li>
        <li>AP Computer Science A</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Grading</h2>
      <p>
        Since the class is treated as an independent study, students are given
        deadlines (usually about two weeks) to complete up to a certain point of
        their current project. They show the teacher and submit what they have,
        and then the teacher gives them the next step. Grades are given based on
        completion and effort, as well as getting the code in on time.
